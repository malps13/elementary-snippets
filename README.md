===================

This repository contains some handy scripts made with Elementary OS in thought, but som of these might actually be OK to work with on other distros as well.

# switch-workspace

Simple script for switching between Elementary OS desktops without additional, empty desktop. I've always been finding it annoying with the eOS built-in workspace switching that I had to switch throught this additional, empty one, so here is the fix.

## Installation

1. Copy **switch.workspace** file to /usr/local/bin.
2. Install Elementary Tweaks: **sudo apt-get install elementary-tweaks**
3. Open **System Settings -> Tweaks** and add new shortcut to **switch-workspace** command
4. Enjoy!
